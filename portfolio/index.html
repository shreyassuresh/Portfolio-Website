        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <p> I am currently pursuing a Btech in Computer Science Engineering at Parul University. 
            I am a dedicated and passionate learner who is constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow both personally and professionally.
            In addition to my studies, I am also a skilled archery sports person and enthusiast. 
            My love for the sport has taught me discipline, focus, and determination, qualities that I bring to all areas of my life. 
            I am also an avid chess player and enjoy playing during my leisure hours.
            I am a great learner and always open to new ideas and perspectives.
            My passion for technology and my drive to constantly improve myself have led me to pursue a career in the field of computer science. I am excited to see where my education and skills will take me in the future.
